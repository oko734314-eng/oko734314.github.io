  <h1>For You, My Love ✨</h1>

  <p id="letter">
    You're my haven.
You're so special, you know that? You're unique and most importantly rare. No one can smile the way you do, No one has your personality, how you carry yourself through worse situation, how your eyes holds up everything even when you're hurt deep inside, The way your eyes lights up when you see something that makes you happy, How you try to distant yourself when you're hurt, How you hide yourself from world, How you always wake up with smile on your face, How you act everything's fine when it's not. No one can ever be you, No one else is like you. Know that? I love this sweet boy always. I accept this sweet boy with my full heart, accepts his all little flaws that makes him more special and human. I know you're having a hard time, life has been hard overall. Just remember you're not alone in this fight, Don't say you have no one, because I am here for you, Don't give up on yourself or on us. 
I'm so proud of you.❤️
    <br><br>
    Yours only, always ❤️
